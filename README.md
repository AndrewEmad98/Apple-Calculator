# Apple-Calculator

I implement Apple Calculator that works in all iPhone and iPad devices using Auto Layout engine

I use Solid Principles to write clean code,you can add any new operation by conforming Operationable protocol to keep this system components loosly coupled with each other

MVC architectural design pattern is applied in this project
